# Project Survey - week 10 

This weeks assignment was to build an application using React. 

## The problem

An application built using React, is built using components, who basically follow the same structure import some things, and we export a function .....We use components to tell React what we want to see on the screen.

The biggest problem this week was to understad the logic between the components.
